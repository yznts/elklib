# elklib

Simple Go library for controlling ELK Bluetooth LED devices.
Based on the [elk-led-controller](https://github.com/b1scoito/elk-led-controller) Rust implementation, but simplified.

Active maintenance and development are not guaranteed (but not excluded). The code was written and published as part of the hobby project.
